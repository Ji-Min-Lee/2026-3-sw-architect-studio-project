## 2-A. Latency: Thread Separation

> 📢 **PRESENT** (~4 min) · Evidence: [EXP-02](references/experiments/exp-02-realtime-deadline-compliance.md) · Decision: [ADR-001](references/adr/ADR-001-t2-dsp-offload-thread.md)

**Problem**: GUI replot blocks DSP processing on a single thread → 43% deadline miss on RPi

![DSP Pipeline Thread Model](assets/view3-thread-model.png)

**Decision**: Separate into three threads — T1 (audio capture) · T2 (DSP) · Qt main (rendering), connected by a lock-free ring buffer

| Metric | Before (single thread) | After (T2 offload) |
|--------|:----------------------:|:------------------:|
| wait_ms avg | 420 ms | **0.013 ms** (×32,000) |
| Deadline miss | 43% | **0%** (macOS) · RPi: E2-8 scheduled |
| Backlog | Present | **None** |

> 🔴 **Unresolved**: FG scheduling — fg_wait avg 60.1ms, 84% > deadline → E2-8 (6/22)

## 2-B. Correctness: Observer Pattern

> 📢 **PRESENT** (~3 min) · Evidence: QAS-1 Measurement Accuracy (governing goal)

**Problem**: Measurement results must be delivered consistently to all tabs. Direct per-tab calls increase coupling and risk missed updates.

**Decision**: Qt Signal-Slot as Observer — `MeasurementEngine` publishes a `Measurement` struct; all tabs subscribe

```
MeasurementEngine  ── Qt Signal: measurement(Measurement) ──▶  GraphTabManager
                                                                     ├── TraceTab::updateData(m)
                                                                     ├── VarioTab::updateData(m)
                                                                     └── … (14 tabs, same Measurement received)
```

**Effects**:
- `MeasurementEngine` has no knowledge of tabs → measurement logic and display logic fully decoupled
- Adding a new tab requires zero changes to `MeasurementEngine` → correctness preserved
- Qt `QueuedConnection` — safe cross-thread delivery from T2 (DSP) to Qt main thread

## 2-C. Extensibility: Layer + Interface + Entity/VO

> 📢 **PRESENT** (~4 min) · Evidence: [QAS-4 Extensibility/Modifiability](references/qa/qas-4-extensibility-modifiability.md)

Three design decisions together enforce extensibility.

### Layer — 4-Layer Allowed-to-Use

![4-Layer Allowed-to-Use View](assets/view1-layered-module.png)

Acquisition → Signal Processing → Domain → Presentation. Dependencies flow downward only.  
Adding a new tab = ≤ 3 files in Presentation. Zero changes to Domain or below. ✅ 14 tabs implemented.

**Dependency Structure Matrix (actual code — `#include` trace)**

Row = **used module** (depended upon) · Column = **using module** (depends on) · `1` = depends · `-` = self · `🔴` = layer violation

| used ↓ \ using → | Presentation | UI Coord | Sig.Proc | Domain | Acquisition |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **Presentation** (`*Tab`, `BaseGraphTab`) | - | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| **UI Coord** (`MainWindow`, `SessionCtrl`) | 0 | - | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| **Sig.Proc** (`DSPWorker`, `MeasurementEngine`) | 1 | 1 | - | 0 | 0 |
| **Domain** (`Measurement`, `WatchMath`, `WatchDiagnostics`) | 1 | 1 | 1 | - | 0 |
| **Acquisition** (`IAudioSource`, `AudioWorker`, `AudioRingBuffer`) | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | - |

> **Layer boundary note**: `MeasurementEngine` is classified in the Sig.Proc layer because it is directly owned and driven by `DSPWorker` within the T2 thread pipeline (`DSPWorker.h:37`, `DSPWorker.cpp:12`). It does not belong to Domain — it calls `processBlock()` as part of the DSP loop, not as a stand-alone domain service. Pure domain objects (`Measurement` VO, `WatchMath`, `WatchDiagnostics`) remain in the Domain layer and have no upward dependencies.

**Key observations:**
- All 1s are in the lower triangle → no layer violations ✅
- Domain column is all `0` → pure computation, no upward dependency ✅
- Presentation is never used by lower layers ✅

### Interface — IAudioSource Dependency Inversion

![IAudioSource Dependency Inversion](assets/view5-iaudiosource.png)

3 concrete sources exist: `AudioWorker` (mic) · `PlaybackWorker` (file) · `SimWorker` (simulation)

| | AS-IS | TO-BE |
|---|-------|-------|
| `connect()` blocks | 3 (one per concrete worker, scattered) | **1** (unified in `SessionController`) |
| Changing audio wiring | Touch multiple files | **1 place** |
| Readability | Duplicated logic per source | Single interface contract |

### Entity / Value Object — Domain Layer

The `Measurement` struct published by `MeasurementEngine` is composed of three VOs:

![Domain Entity / Value Object Module View](assets/view6-domain-entity-vo.png)

| Value Object | Contents | Immutability |
|---|---|---|
| `WatchMetrics` | Rate (s/d), Amplitude (°), Beat Error (ms), BPH | Immutable after computation |
| `SignalFrame` | PCM sample block + timestamp | Immutable after capture |
| `AcousticEvent` | Individual beat event (T1/T3 timestamps) | Immutable after detection |

Tabs receive `Measurement` as read-only → cannot mutate measurement results → correctness guaranteed.  
VOs stay in the Domain layer → replacing or adding Presentation components has zero impact on domain logic.

## 2-D. Risk: AI-Assisted Unit Test

> 📢 **PRESENT** (~1 min) · Evidence: [NTR-07](references/risks.md) — domain knowledge gap

**Risk**: Most team members lack watch measurement domain expertise (Rate, Amplitude, Beat Error) → hard to verify correctness of tab implementations

**Response**: AI-generated unit tests — structural correctness of `BaseGraphTab::updateData()` verifiable without domain expertise

- Validates interface compliance and layer boundary enforcement → runnable on macOS immediately
- All 14 tabs completed within W2 Sprint 1 without a domain expert
